      <p>Real talk: confidence isn’t something you magically have—it’s something you build.</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever thought, “I wish I was more confident,” you’re not alone. Most people don’t feel confident all the time—and that’s okay. True confidence comes from how you think about yourself, not how you look or how loud you are.</p>
      <p>So if you’re ready to stop doubting yourself and start trusting your own voice, here are 7 mindset shifts that can actually change how you feel about yourself—practically, gently, and without pretending to be someone else.</p>

      <article>
        <h4>1. “I need to be perfect” → “I just need to begin.” ✨</h4>
        <p>Perfection is a trap. Progress is what builds confidence.</p>
        <p>Waiting until everything is “just right” keeps you stuck. Confidence grows when you show up—even if things feel messy.</p>
        <blockquote>“Start before you’re ready. That’s how confidence is built.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Take one tiny action today. Press publish. Speak up. Try again. Just start.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>2. “I’m not confident” → “I’m learning confidence.”</h4>
        <p>You don’t need to have it all figured out.</p>
        <p>Confidence isn’t something you’re born with—it’s something you build. Every time you show up despite fear, you’re practicing.</p>
        <blockquote>“You’re not behind. You’re just building.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> When you feel doubt creeping in, whisper: “This is part of the process.”</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>3. “I failed” → “I learned.”</h4>
        <p>Failure isn’t the end. It’s the middle.</p>
        <p>Every confident person you admire has faced rejection, embarrassment, and failure. What matters is they kept going.</p>
        <blockquote>“Every mistake is feedback. Not a verdict.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> After a setback, write down 1 thing it taught you. Then keep moving.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>4. “What will people think?” → “What do I think?”</h4>
        <p>Self trust &gt; other people’s opinions.</p>
        <p>You can’t build confidence if you’re always looking outside for approval. Start checking in with yourself first.</p>
        <blockquote>“Confidence is quiet. It’s knowing what you stand for—even if no one claps.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Before making a choice, ask: “What would I do if no one had an opinion?”</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>5. “Confidence looks like them” → “Confidence looks like me.”</h4>
        <p>There’s no one right way to be confident.</p>
        <p>Confidence isn’t always loud. It can be calm, thoughtful, kind, or even quiet. You don’t need to change who you are to feel strong.</p>
        <blockquote>“You don’t have to fake bold to feel confident. You just have to be real.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Define what confidence means for you. Let go of someone else’s version.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>6. “If I were confident, I wouldn’t feel scared” → “It’s okay to feel fear and still go for it.”</h4>
        <p>Fear is normal. It doesn’t mean you’re weak—it means you’re stepping into growth. Confidence is moving with the fear, not waiting for it to disappear.</p>
        <blockquote>“Courage is feeling the fear and choosing to act anyway.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Next time you feel scared, say: “I can be afraid and still move forward.”</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>7. “I don’t believe in myself” → “I’m learning to trust myself.”</h4>
        <p>Trust is built—just like confidence.</p>
        <p>You don’t need to feel 100% ready. You just need to keep showing up. Little by little, trust grows.</p>
        <blockquote>“Confidence isn’t loud. It’s the quiet knowing that you’ve got your own back.”</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Keep one small promise to yourself today. Just one. That’s how trust starts.</p>

      <p>You don’t need to have all the answers.</p>
      <p>You don’t need to be perfect.</p>
      <p>You just need to keep going. To shift your thoughts gently. To trust that you’re growing—even when it feels slow.</p>
